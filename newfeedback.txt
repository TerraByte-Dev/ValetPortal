Okay, we are close to production. lets remove (optional) from everything, besides Shift Notes. 
Lets change the header "Valet Management Portal" to "Team Portal" 
Add functionality to the Pricing page under About, selecting pricing prompts them to enter a contact email for sales, as it isnt really set up for wide distrobution, but I want to leave it there and open the possibility for professionality.
Remove "BULK PIN RESET" there is no need anymore.
Deleting users doesnt seem to work in adminview, even when typing "DELETE" or "delete" -- say a user is deleted, it should NOT override all their reported data/shift reports. They just are no longer a user.
buttons that use black text, need to have white text instead, because the black is hard to read.
