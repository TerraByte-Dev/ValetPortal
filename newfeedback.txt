The more responsible lead/closer are a bit smarter, so I think to keep it easy on the runner valets, dont show cars handles, or payment screenshots. Payment screenshots, cars handled, should only be viewable by a Lead/Closer variation of the submisison.
If cash value and or digital value are empty, just assume 0, instead of requiring input for submission.
